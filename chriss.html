.Data generation: occurs regardless of whether you’re aware of it, especially in our increasingly online world.<br> Some of this data is generated by your organization, some by your customers,<br> and some by third parties you may or may not be aware of.<br> 
2. Collection : Not all of the data that’s generated every day is collected or used. It’s up to your data team to identify what information should be captured and the best means for doing so,<br> and what data is unnecessary or irrelevant to the project at hand.<br>
You can collect data in a variety of ways, including:<br>
•	Forms: Web forms, client or customer intake forms, vendor forms,<br> and human resources applications are some of the most common ways businesses generate data.<br>
•	Surveys: Surveys can be an effective way to gather vast amounts of information from a large number of respondents.<br>
•	Interviews: Interviews and focus groups conducted with customers, users, or job applicants offer opportunities to gather qualitative and subjective data that may be difficult to capture through other means.<br>
•	Direct Observation: Observing how a customer interacts with your website, application, or product can be an effective way to gather data that may not be offered through the methods above.<br>
3. Processing : Once data has been collected, it must be processed. Data processing can refer to various activities, including:
•	Data wrangling, in which a data set is cleaned and transformed from its raw form into something more accessible and usable. This is also known as data cleaning, data munging, or data remediation.
•	Data compression, in which data is transformed into a format that can be more efficiently stored.
•	Data encryption, in which data is translated into another form of code to protect it from privacy concerns.
4. Storage : After data has been collected and processed, it must be stored for future use. This is most commonly achieved through the creation of databases or datasets. These datasets may then be stored in the cloud, on servers, or using another form of physical storage like a hard drive, CD, cassette, or floppy disk.
When determining how to best store data for your organization, it’s important to build in a certain level of redundancy to ensure that a copy of your data will be protected and accessible, even if the original source becomes corrupted or compromised.
5. Management : Data management, also called database management, involves organizing, storing, and retrieving data as necessary over the life of a data project. While referred to here as a “step,” it’s an ongoing process that takes place from the beginning through the end of a project. Data management includes everything from storage and encryption to implementing access logs and changelogs that track who has accessed data and what changes they may have made.
6. Analysis : Data analysis refers to processes that attempt to glean meaningful insights from raw data. Analysts and data scientists use different tools and strategies to conduct these analyses. Some of the more commonly used methods include statistical modeling, algorithms, artificial intelligence, data mining, and machine learning.
Exactly who performs an analysis depends on the specific challenge being addressed, as well as the size of your organization’s data team. Business analysts, data analysts, and data scientists can all play a role.
7. Visualization : Data visualization refers to the process of creating graphical representations of your information, typically through the use of one or more visualization tools. Visualizing data makes it easier to quickly communicate your analysis to a wider audience both inside and outside your organization. The form your visualization takes depends on the data you’re working with, as well as the story you want to communicate.
8. Interpretation: Finally, the interpretation phase of the data life cycle provides the opportunity to make sense of your analysis and visualization. Beyond simply presenting the data, this is when you investigate it through the lens of your expertise and understanding. Your interpretation may not only include a description or explanation of what the data shows but, more importantly, what the suggestions may be.
•	Data manipulation 
Manipulation of data is the process of manipulating or changing information to make it more organized and readable.
For example, in alphabetical order, a log of data may be sorted, making it easier to find individual entries. On web server logs, data manipulation is also used to allow the website owner to monitor their most famous pages and their sources of traffic.
Accounting users or related fields also manipulate information to assess the expense of the product, pricing patterns, future tax.
•	Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. Additionally, it provides an excellent way for employees or business owners to present data to non-technical audiences without confusion.</h1>
